# Single Price Grid Component

## This is one of the challenges from frontendmentor.io! For this project, and I wanted to go old school and use basic CSS. I'll be using floats, clears, and other methods for the layout. No Flexbox or Grid Layout. I will be using RWD and such, but really wanted to use old school techniques on this guy. You can find the design in the design folder!
